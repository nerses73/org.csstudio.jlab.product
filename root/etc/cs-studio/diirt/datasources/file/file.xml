    <!-- By default, file notifications are done with the watch service only, which
        works for most cases. In others, OS notification are not available
        (e.g. network file systems), so in this case we provide polling as
        a fallback. Use with caution as too many concurrent polling may
        create performance problems. For this reason, intervals shorter
        than 1 second are not supported. The unit for interval is seconds
        and must be an integer. -->
